| BUBBLE SORT |
===============

It is a sorting algorithm which loops through a given array of elements and compares each pair of adjacent elements one after the other. In any of the adjacent pairs, if the first element is greater than the second element, then it swaps the elements and if not, then it moves on to the next pair of elements. The end objective of bubble sort is to sort the given array in ascending order.

(1) for i = 0 to n-1
 (1.1) for j = 0 to n-1
   (1.1.1) if arr[j] > arr[j+1]
     (1.1.1.1) swap arr[j] and arr[j+1]
    (1.1.2) end if
 (1.2) end for
(2) end for
